# EsperTask
The list has variants of mobiles, storage options & feature sets. For individual mobile, every storage option and every feature set is not available. Implemented the functionality where we can't select that unavailable feature.

## The app has following packages:
- data: It contains all the data accessing and manipulating components.
- ui: View classes along with their corresponding ViewModel.
- utils: Utility classes.

## Components
- Glide - A powerful image downloading and caching library for Android https://github.com/bumptech/glide

- Data Binding - This is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

- Room - The Room persistence library provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite. (https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room)
